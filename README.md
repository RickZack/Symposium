# Symposium: the collaboration place

## Summary
Symposium is an free, real-time, collaborative text editor written in C++ language. Like in the ancient Greece, Symposium allows you to collaborate and exchange ideas with other people in a environment that suits you.

It's developed on purpose for an academic project, but it is intnded to remain free for your contribution. Symposium is a client-server software that uses **Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types** (CRDT) to make sure all users stay in-sync.
